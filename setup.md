For this lesson you will need **OpenRefine** (formerly Google Refine) and a
web browser.

Note: this is a Java program that runs on your machine (not in the cloud). It runs inside your browser, but no web connection is needed.



#### Windows

default browser. OpenRefine runs in your default browser. It will not run correctly in Internet Explorer.
- Download software from [http://openrefine.org](http://openrefine.org)
- Unzip the downloaded file into a directory by right-clicking and 
selecting “Extract…”. Name that directory something like OpenRefine.
- Go to your newly created OpenRefine directory.
- Launch OpenRefine
- Click the google-refine.exe (this will launch a command prompt window, but you can ignore that and wait for the browser to launch)
- If you are using a different browser, or OpenRefine does not automatically open for you, point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:3333/ or http://localhost:3333 to launch the program.
