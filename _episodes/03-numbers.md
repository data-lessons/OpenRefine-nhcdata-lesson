# Lesson

## Numbers

When a table is imported into OpenRefine, all columns are treated as having text values. We saw earlier how we can sort column values as numbers, but this does not change the cells in a column from text to numbers. Rather, this interprets the values as numbers for the purposes of sorting but keeps the underlying data type as is. We can, however, transform columns to other data types (e.g. number or date) using the `Edit cells` > `Common transforms` feature. Here we will experiment changing columns to numbers and see what additional capabilities that grants us.

Be sure to remove any `Text filter` facets you have enabled from the left panel so that we can examine our whole dataset. You can remove an existing facet by clicking the `x` in the upper left of that facet window.

The `catalogNumber` field is already a number (it is likely green and right-justified). To transform cells in the `catalogNumber` column to text, click the down arrow for that column, then `Edit cells` > `Common transformsâ€¦` > `To text`. You will notice the `catalogNumber` values change from right-justified to left-justified, and from green color to black. Please change it back`To number`.

### Numeric facet
Sometimes there are *non-number values or blanks* in a column which may represent errors in data entry and we want to find them. 
We can do that with a `Numeric facet`.

> ## Exercise
>
> 1. For a column you transformed to numbers, edit one or two cells, replacing the numbers with text (such as `abc`) or blank (no number or text).
> 2. Use the pulldown menu to apply a numeric facet to the column you edited. The facet will appear in the left panel.
> 3. Notice that there are several checkboxes in this facet: `Numeric`, `Non-numeric`, `Blank`, and `Error`. Below these are counts of the number of cells in each category. You should see checks for `Non-numeric` and `Blank` if you changed some values.
> 4. Experiment with checking or unchecking these boxes to select subsets of your data.
{: .challenge}

When done examining the numeric data, remove this facet by clicking the `x` in the upper left corner of its panel. Note that this does not undo the edits you made to the cells in this column. If you want to reverse these edits, use the `Undo / Redo` function.

## Scatterplot facet

Now that we have multiple columns representing numbers, we can see how they relate to one another and the text columns using the scatterplot facet. Select a numeric column, for example `weight`, and use the pulldown menu to > `Facet` > `Scatterplot facet`. A new window called `Scatterplot Matrix` will appear. There are squares for each pair of numeric columns organized in an upper right triangle. Each square has little dots for the cell values from each row.

> ## Exercise
>
> 1. Examine the scatterplots overall. Do the patterns make sense?
> 2. Does the scatterplot for `weight` vs `month` look reasonable?
{: .challenge}

## Examine pair of columns in detail

We can examine one pair of columns by clicking on its square in the `Scatterplot Matrix`. A new facet with only that pair will appear in the left margin panel. Choose the scatterplot for `month (x)` vs `weight (y)` so we can look at it in more detail. 

> ## Exercise
>
> Click in the scatterplot facet in the left margin and drag to highlight a rectangle around one of the vertical lines representing `weight` for a given `month (x)`. This will subset the data to those entries.
{: .challenge}

> ## Exercise
> 
> - Click on the `Scatterplot Matrix` square for `month (x)` and `weight(y)` to get that as a facet in the left margin.
> - Now Redo the `Text filter` on `scientificName` to show only entries including the letters `tra`.
> Notice the change in the scatterplot. It might be easier to see if you click `export plot` to put it on a new browser tab.
{: .challenge}

> ## Exercise
> 
> - How could you see all the specimens collected in California, by a given collector (Patton) and displayed them on a map using the scatterplot facet? 
> > 1. First on the `scientificName` column > `Facet` > `Text facet`. 
> > 2. On the `recordedBy` column > `Facet` > `Text facet`.
> > 3. On the `recordedBy` column > `Text filter` > enter *patton*. Now you have only data for specimens collected by Patton.
> > 4. For `stateProvince` do > `Facet` > `Text facet` > and `include` only *california*. Now we have only rows where `recordedBy` contains *patton* and `stateProvince`=*california*.
> > 5. For `decimalLongitude` > `Facet` > `Scatterplot facet` > click on the facet that is labeled `decimalLongitude(x)` vs. `decimalLatitude (y)` to get a facet graph in the left margin panel.
> > 6. Notice the change in the scatterplot. It might be easier to see if you click `export plot` to put it on a new browser tab. How could you do this so that the graph only included California points? HINT: it involves dataset export from Open Refine.
